# #Ô∏è‚É£ Boids
Boids is an artificial life program created by Craig Reynolds in 1986, designed to simulate the flocking behavior of birds in a realistic way. The name "Boids" is a play on the word "birds" in a New York accent. The simulation produces realistic flocking patterns using simple rules known as Steering Behaviors.
## üïπÔ∏è Game
This is a 0-player game, where the Boids autonomously simulate flocking behavior based on three simple rules:
## üìã Rules
 1) Separation: Avoid crowding nearby Boids by steering to maintain a comfortable distance.
 2) Alignment: Steer towards the average direction of neighboring Boids.
 3) Cohesion: Steer towards the average position of nearby Boids to stay close to the flock.
